Master Thesis: Melatonin on Mood, Sleep Impairments Matter. <br/>

The current study aimed to determine if the effect of MLT on mood can be predicted by sleep complaints (SC) when not on MLT in people with Subthreshold Insomnia (SI). As part of a larger double-blinded, crossover study design, 46 participants (Female = 27, Mean age = 29.98 ± 12.72 years) reported their sleep quality, as measured by Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Restorative Sleep Questionnaire (RSQ), and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and mood change, measured by Profile of Mood States (POMS) after two weeks of using MLT (.5mg/spray, as needed) vs. placebo. Several independent sample t-tests were conducted to test for differences in SC scores under placebo between participants who reported an increased mood after using MLT and those who reported a decreased mood after using MLT across seven POMS parameters. <br/>

People who reported a decrease in negative moods (i.e., confusion, depression, fatigue, tension, and total mood disturbances) reported higher SC under placebo. People who demonstrated an increase in vigor reported higher SC under placebo. Changes in anger were not associated with SC under a placebo. These results suggest that MLT is most likely to precipitate larger beneficial changes in mood for people who experienced the most SC without it.

Capstone Project. Revenue Predictions for the US Movie Industry. <br/>

Using data from 2012 - 2016, several linear regression analysis were conducted to predict revenue based on the budget for each released movies. Results from the analysis show that: 
1. Action movies generated the most profits and revenues. With lots of budgets, it is the most popular genre.
2. It is best to have a movie with a budget around $25 - $50 millions, or $100 millions or more, for those movies to generate profits.

**Project Manager, _Intervent Clinical Research Center, FL (2023 - current)_** <br/>
•	Write functions in Python to perform statistical tests, data visualization, and model-building to identify factors contributing to participants’ churning. 
•	Construct a linear regression model to identify the best time to contact patients, use age as a predictor, to (1) estimate the best time to contact participants, and (2) identify participants who are not very responsive to phone calls. <br/>

### World Happiness (2024).
What makes a happy country? Is it the country’s economy, politics, or its people? Using data from the International Database (IDB) by the United States Census Bureau and the World Happiness Report Dataset by the World Happiness Report (WHR) organization, I constructed a Multiple Linear Regression model using 13 predictors to predict happiness. My model explains 84.86% of the variance in happiness, F(13,129) = 62.222, p < .05, r-squared = .849. <br />

According to this model, people are likely to report feeling happier when (1) their country is doing well financially and (2) their health, freedom, and social support are well-taken care of. Surprisingly, a person's perception of corruption in their country does not have an effect on their happiness (i.e., they may perceive a lot of corruption happening in their country, they would not let that determine how happy they are). In countries where people reported feeling happier, the country population tend to be younger; however, their annual death rate seems to be higher, comparing to countries where people reported feeling not as happy. <br />

Due to a lack of experimental control, causation cannot be inferred yet. It is recommended for future studies to explore the relationships between these variables so policies can be made to further increase people's happiness. <br />
